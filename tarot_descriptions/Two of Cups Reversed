Upright, this is one of the most romantic cards in the deck. Eyes across a room, recognition of a kindred soul, a new friend or lover. Flirting, even, and that spark of emotion in the Ace finds an object for its new feelings. Reverse this and you can almost see the two figures not gazing at each other, but with their backs to each other, cups empty. Instead of magnetic attraction, they repel. Or, at best (using a blocked interpretation), they fail to notice each other. Like a romantic comedy where the leads keep missing each other as they walk down the same streets.
