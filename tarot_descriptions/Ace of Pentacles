Ace of Pentacles Tarot Card Meaning
***
New luck, good health or work for new prosperity. There is no desire to burn, flow or fly in the Ace of Pentacles; here is a physical need to be grounded, to make, build and touch. Like a seed in the ground, there is a desire to sprout roots and just become.

The pentacle is taken in hand, and, for now, the querent wants only to have it solidly in his pocket.
