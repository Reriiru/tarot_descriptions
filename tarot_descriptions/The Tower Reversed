The Tower signals a powerful shake-up that will bring down structures that the querent thought were stable but really weren't. With that flash of lightning - the insight that illuminates a dark landscape - the truth is revealed. What seemed to be stable is not, and comes crashing down. All that is left is the bare, harsh truth on which something more stable and real can now be built. In reverse...

1) Opposite: The easiest opposite is that there is no shake-up. No flash of lightning, no destruction. The Tower remains standing, the lies remain in place, the truth remains hidden. The message of the Tower is "The Emperor has no clothes!" but the reversed Tower indicates that the querent refuses to hear it or believe it. And lucky for him, no one shall say it. The lies - and the status quo - are maintained.

2) Blocked: The energy of the Tower is in the lightning flash, the energy of illumination and destruction. Very like in the opposite interpretation, this one suggests that things will remain in the dark and standing. The difference is that there is a desire for the truth to come out. However, someone or something is keeping the truth from being said, and the Tower of lies safe from revelation and destruction.

3) Upside-down: The Tower is the card which places the viewer in the middle of the action - the tower is struck by the bolt and folk go flying. However, in reverse the people seem to be falling back into their windows, the crown (emblematic of arrogance, of the tower proclaiming itself king and on par with heaven) is shooting a bolt into the heavens instead of vice-versa, and the foundation reigns supreme (as compared to the crown on top). The Tower proclaims that its foundation is solid. The crown mocks heaven, and the false builders find their way back in. Not only are the lies not going to be revealed, but the liars are going to get away with worse. They are protected by the rocky foundation which now crowns them, and there is no throwing them out.
