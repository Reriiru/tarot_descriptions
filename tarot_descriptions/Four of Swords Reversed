Four of Swords Reversed

***
Upright, this is a card of rest, recuperation or meditation - a retreat to regain health and mental sharpness. Reverse this and the man falls off his pallet. Clearly, the reversed card indicates that there is no rest, no retreat and no recuperation. The querent may want or need it, but they are not going to get it.
