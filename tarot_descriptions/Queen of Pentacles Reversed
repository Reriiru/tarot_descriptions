Queen of Pentacles is about getting things done practically...but tastefully. Whether investing money or just hard work, this queen knows who to hire and isn't afraid to get her own hands dirty. This is the Martha Stewart type. She will plant the flowers, hang the pictures, reupholster the furniture. She is also a consummate business woman who keeps scrupulous accounts.

The negatives of the Queen of Pentacles, as seen in her reversal, a woman who insists that everything be the best and won't accept anything less. A boss who expects everyone to work as hard as she does - with no sympathy for anyone who can't (she worked when she was pregnant, why can't her secretary do the same?). A person who thinks there is a practical solution to every problem: "Just buy another!" she might say to a child who has lost her favorite teddy bear.

The Queen of Pentacles is a card about practical solutions to problems, physical solutions. When reversed, therefore, it can signal blockage or problems with that answer. Materials haven't arrived, plants aren't growing, the things ordered have arrived but they're all wrong. Internally, a person may have an injury preventing them from physically doing the work, whatever the work is, and running their business.
