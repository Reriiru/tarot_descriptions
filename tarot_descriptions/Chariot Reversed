Upright, the Chariot is all about moving forward. It's not just about charging ahead, but rather seeing where you want to go, picking up the reins, taking control of inner and outer forces, and directing everything forward. Hence, it is a card of great determination and confidence, motivation and leadership. Without these, there's no making the chariot go where you want it to go. So what about reversed?

1) Opposite: The image in Rider-Waite is of the chariot at rest, either after its victory or before. We'll leave the movement interpretations for the other two and interpret this one in relation to victory. Obviously, the opposite would be defeat. The chariot did not conquer either the inner or outer forces; it lost the battle to control the horses, lost the battle against whatever it was fighting.

2) Blocked: as the upright card often focuses on controlling the horses, on determination and direction, we can see that a blocking of these energies leaves the querent at loose ends. The querent may know where he wants to go...but he doesn't have a clue how to get there, and lacks the determination to find a way to get there. The energy of determination and direction must be unblocked. Otherwise, he's going to be driving about aimlessly and hopelessly to the point where his attitude is "what's the use?" 

3) Upside-down: Turn the chariot upside-down and no one is going anywhere. The wheels are in the air, the horses on their backs, the charioteer throw from the interior. Car accident is an apt if frightening prediction for this one, but not the only one. At its worst, the reversed Chariot is not merely about a loss of control and direction, but the complete loss of any means to get where you're going. You won't be leading anyone to victory, there's no fighting the war, let alone winning it. Anything inside (motivations, determination, energy) or outside of you is not working, not moving.
