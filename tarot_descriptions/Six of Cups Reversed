The nostalgia card is about finding answers in the past, in old friends, old family members, even just memories of youth and innocence. Reverse this and such memories or friends and family cause more problems than answers. If I got the reversed Six of Cups for a querent, I'd say that their childhood was so bad that anything that reminds them of it causes them emotional upset rather than emotional peace and joy.

If I got this card for them, I'd be very worried that they were going to run into a relative or old friend who had caused them pain and problems. A glance back at their school yearbook would only have them remembering how miserable they were, not, as with the upright card, their first love or happier times.
