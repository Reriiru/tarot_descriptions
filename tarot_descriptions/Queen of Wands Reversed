The Queen of Wands is a Queen of energy and warmth, who is always center stage, even as she directs the action. Hers is a charisma that can get things done whether it's raising money for charity, putting on a play or getting a politician elected. This is the woman with all the connections, all the friends to call or e-mail. She makes things happen.

The negatives of this Queen, however, seen in her reversal, is that she can easily intimidate. You will do things her way. She refuses to listen to the opinions of others, she knows best. She becomes, as discussed, almost a dominatrix, one with a terrible temper if you happen to cross or go against her. And if you fall out of favor with her, she will call all those friends and make sure you are abandoned. The Queen of the social scene will have you snubbed.

The Queen of Wands is the Queen of energy and getting things done by way of energy, faith, charisma and friendship. Reverse her and we have a real lack of energy, a loss of faith. A woman who disappears rather than stands out, a woman who as no friends. Externally, this card could signal a drop in social status, friends are not willing or able to help. Internally, this card could easily signal chronic fatigue syndrome.
