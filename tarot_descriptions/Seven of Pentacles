A farmer leans on his spade gazing at pentacles that grow on a bush like fruit. He has done all the work, planted, planned, toiled. Now, all he can do is wait. And wait he has, for so long that he's growing impatient. He's beginning to doubt that the fruit on this tree will ever be ready to harvest and sell.

In all four Sevens, the challenge presented cannot be won unless the querent is determined to succeed and will not let himself give up. The challenge in the solid, earthy Pents emphasizes this the most. Sometimes called "Failure" this is a card where one's patience is beginning to wear thin. You may be tempted to announce that it's all a failure and walk away. Or, weary of waiting, you could make a mistake, assume that the fruit is ripe when it's not.

This is an especially hard card (and challenge) for someone who has been out of work for a while, or has been trying to get back their health. They have to be told that, hard as it is, they must extend their patience. They must also be careful to recognize real opportunity from false opportunity. It's all too easy to act out of frustration, thinking that doing anything is better than doing nothing.

But acting out of frustration can lead to failure. Real opportunity is on its way. Hang in there and use all you've learned to recognize it when you see it.
