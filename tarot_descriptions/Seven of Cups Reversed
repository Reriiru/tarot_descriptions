The "illusion" card presents a variety of tempting cups, but which of these futures are possible to achieve and which are unrealistic dreams? The card doesn't say. Troubling as this card is, however, the reverse is worse. As with all cup cards, what the cups contain is spilled out. And in this case, the querent has not even illusions to motivate them to continue on. They've stopped dreaming, imagining, wishing.

If I got this card I would seriously worry that my querent might be on the downward spiral of a drug habit or suicidal depression. This is a person who sees no possibilities of life getting better, not realistically or in a pipe-dream sense. They are stuck and going nowhere. We all need fantasies to keep us going. This man has none.
