Two of Wands Reversed

***
Upright, this is a card about making an intuitive choice. There are two possibilities, equally good, and the querent judges them and goes with is instinct after one or the other. Reversed, it seems quite clear that a decision cannot be made. The blocked interpretation is most clear for this - something is preventing the person from seeing any difference in the two, from being able to tell which is the one in which to invest his energy.
