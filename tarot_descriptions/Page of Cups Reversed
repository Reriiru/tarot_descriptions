Upright, this card is about a very sensitive and gentle newcomer, one with the soul of a poet. Deeply imaginative and empathetic, they will really care about your opinion and try hard to please you.

Reverse this card, and our newcomer is someone who is hard to motivate. They're sad all the time and they'll bring your mood down with them. This is the apprentice who does his work but grudgingly, as if wondering what the point was. They may also weep and cry way too easily and over nothing - dealing with them is hard as you have to walk on eggshells.

If not a person, the upright Page of Cups relates to love letters and messages from your loving family. Reverse this and you can expect sad messages, word of break-ups, divorce, infidelity, alcoholism, drugs. The romance or family in trouble.
