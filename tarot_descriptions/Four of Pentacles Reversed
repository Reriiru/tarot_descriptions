Four of Pentacles Reversed

***

Often called the Miser card the Four of Pentacles suggests that the person is hanging on to what they have, perhaps a little too hard. Reversed this card would suggest the opposite, that the person is profligate, throwing away all their money, spending it and keeping nothing for a rainy day. This might suggest a gambler or spendthrift, someone who is lending out money with abandon, or buying drinks for everyone at the bar or just buying things they don't need. Likewise, they might be ruining their health or pressing their luck.
