The "nightmare" card. This certainly is a card about having too many anxieties and worries, to the point where it haunts your dreams and wakes you in the night. Swords are hanging over your head. This is the "maturity" of the suit in that the mind is filled with ideas - the intellect can imagine and speculate too well. There is, however, the assurance in this card that one can wake up, and that such worries maybe overblown, and more in the head than in reality.

Assuming that the swords are attached to that wall, then turning the card upside-down does only one thing - tosses the woman out of bed. So instead of waking from sleep, she's getting no sleep at all. Total insomnia.

Either that, or going for the opposite, this person is sleeping like a baby - but only because they are totally ignoring their problems. "Ignorance is bliss" might be the motto for the opposite of this card. Rather than thinking too much about their problems, this person isn't thinking at all about them - which isn't going to make them go away.
