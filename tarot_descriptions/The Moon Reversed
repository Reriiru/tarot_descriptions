The Moon's usual interpretation often are to do with hallucinations, insanity, wildness... but also dreams, fantasy, artistic talent, creativity, psychic ability, romance. Reversed...

1) Opposite: opposite of this card is not "The Sun", as would apear, but the "Dark of the Moon." The Moon at its very worst, giving its milder interpretations to the upright. By the light of the Moon, we can still find our way - even if wild things do happen by that light. When the Moon is dark, however, dark and primitive things happen. Criminals lurk in the dark, shady folk with dark purposes and intents. Sexual predators instead of romance, artistic talent used to hurt and destroy. Evil fantasies and dreams. 

2) Blocked: The energy of the Moon is that of chaos. It can be insanity or artistic genius, but either way, it is restricted. Blocked suggests a writer's block, perhaps a sexual block, a physical restraint or just force of will. This is not order, so much as a lock on the door, keeping the chaos wildness inside. The calm with this blockage - but it is artificial. The chaos has not been removed or corrected, only locked in. 

3) Upside-down: Turn the card upside down and the creatures are not gazing up at the Moon - the Moon gazes up at them instead. What rules and commands the wild is no longer in charge. Base as these instincts may be, they do have a gut feeling that they are following. It is out of primordial ooze, out of chaos, that order comes (the Sun will follow the Moon), but upside-down, that order is turning into chaos instead. Even the guiding light of the moon has been subjected, and only the primitive reigns - unchecked, directionless, with no purpose or hope of coming to an end. This is the sort of interpretation one might find for revolutions and riots, for countries melting down into political turmoil, for a complete mental breakdown or a merciless plummet into the worst depths of drug addiction.
