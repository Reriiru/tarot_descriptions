As a Message: Page of Swords signals messages relating to information or problems. It is sometimes about illness and often rumor or gossip. When the querent gets the Page of Swords, they should be warned to check it out. They should not pass on the message until they're sure it's true. Swords are words and thoughts, and neither may have any validity behind them.

As Time and Environment: This is a time of new ideas and thoughts. They not only seem new, but unique, special, and there is a great deal of chatter, talk, and discussion. It may not be very mature, but it is rapid and developing fast.

As a Child or "Child-like" Person: You can't shut up the Page of Swords. They want to know everything, be told everything, and, even more alarming, anything they hear, they'll repeat. This is the child that will go up to Aunt Hazel and say, "Are you carrying a baby? Mommy says it looks like you are...." This card could warn the querent that they or someone else might blurts out something they heard that they shouldn't be blurting.

On the positive side, this child or child-like person could be quite a prodigy, good at puzzles, quick to learn. The card can signal absorbing new information quickly, or solving problems fast, also using a computer.

Warn the querent, however, that being "immature" this person will be prone to argue. Not only is there a risk of this Page of Swords being a tattletale, but they tend to think they know-it-all when they don't. This can be a card about boasting, gossip and lying, either knowingly or unknowingly.
