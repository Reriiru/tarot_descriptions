The "last stand" card has a person putting their final reserves of energy into maintaining, guarding and supporting whatever it is they've built. There is the temptation to surrender, to give up, but if they just hold out, they will succeed. It's almost over.

Reverse this and we might well say to our poor soldier that the cavalry aren't coming. The reversed card signals either not having enough energy for that last stand, or a waste of energy. Like putting all your energy into an important sales pitch and succeeding, only to find that your bosses have changed their minds about the deal. Trying to save the fort wasn't worth the effort.
