Upright, the High Priestess is a mysterious card, both frightening and wonderful. Where the Magician is the charismatic showman with an audience, the HPS is the solitary lady guarding an ancient library. Secret knowledge, instincts, even magic. Hers is a card about personal and individual journeys across dark deserts to enlightenment. She is also about that moment when opposites both exist but don't cancel each other out.

1) Opposite: There are negatives in the card that a reader might save for reversals. In this case, secrets are kept or not revealed, the answer is searched for but not found, instincts are wrong. In a more personal sense, the High Priestess refuses to open the door, withholds her secrets except when hurtful. She can also be that unpredictable person in one's life - brilliant but frighteningly unstable. You don't know if she's going to coldly answer your question - or bite your head off.

2) Blocked: The blocking here really focuses on the instinctual or psychic energy. There is just nothing coming through. Once of those days when you do a tarot reading and the cards are just cards. They don't speak to you, you see nothing in them. Likewise, making a decision about anything seems impossible. The two wands look the same and you cannot tell the difference between them.

3) Upside-down: There would seem to be little difference if we turn the card upside-down, but while subtle, it is present. The priestess has the crescent moon at her foot and a well-spring of water begins there that runs through other cards. Upside-down, the water falls and runs dry. The moon hangs above rather than at her command. The curtain of pomegranates, shrouding the mysteries, falls open, and all that people need not see - that might be damaging to see - they see. The pillars are on their crowns and cannot support themselves. There is a loss of control. And the High Priestess, holding opposites in delicate balance, needs that control. All that is lost, and chaos reigns.
