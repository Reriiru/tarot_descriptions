Upright, our cool, Queen of Swords is a very sharp and astute intelligence. Far-sighted, she is the consummate problem-solver, especially when it comes to solving problems in communications - including important communications like radio and television - science or technology. She has all her facts at her fingertips and if she doesn't she knows how to get them.

Personality-wise, a reversed Queen of Swords can also indicate the worst qualities of this Queen. Aloof and distant, cold, cruel even. A woman who uses her information and communication ability without considering other people's feelings or what damage it might do. She wins arguments by saying, "These are the facts and that is that," she says harshly, with no tact at all--or in the nastiest way possible.

The Queen of Swords is all about communications and information, using them to solve problems. Reverse this card and our Queen's ability to solve problems is blocked, as is her access to information. Mental acuity and verbalizing are turned upside-down. These problems may be exterior - things like computers, telephones breaking down, arguments and miscommunication. It could also be interior problems: memory loss, even a stroke.
