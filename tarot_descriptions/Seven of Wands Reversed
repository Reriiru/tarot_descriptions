The "holding your ground" card indicates that you use your energy to defend your position, even if it's not popular. There is no indication in the card if the person holding his ground is right or wrong, only that he must hold his ground to achieve his goal. Reversed, we get the opposite: that the person can't or won't be able to hold their ground; that they will immediately fold under pressure, drop to their knees and surrender rather than try to defend themselves or stand up for what they believe in. They may have faith in their ideas or religion, but they haven't the stomach to fight for those ideas or religion, not when others insist that they're wrong.
