Knight of Cups Reversed

***

The sensitive Knight of Cups travels from place to place to sing his love songs. This is a deeply creative knight, poet, musician, painter, writer. He is a soulful artist, still new, but with great promise. A gentle soul he's a Good Samaritan, a fantastic and empathetic listener and friend. This is the boy who is close with women and learns all their heartfelt secrets--or the girl who gets guys to open up to her.

Reversed, however, this Knight sinks into gloom and depression. The glass is always half-empty, they wear only black, and whatever story they tell ends in tragedy. Far from being romantic, this knight is cynical and can use their insights into human nature to wound people, to make others hurt as much as they, themselves hurt. Young-Adult-wise they might suffer from problems common to teens, hormonal imbalances, moodiness, being rude and bitter and rebellious. Also, and most troubling, he might be suicidal.

Contrariwise, they could be hyper sensitive, finding insult in the smallest things, crying excessively, showing timidity, changing their minds all the time. There is no way to make arrangements with this person; they won't make it because they've changed their minds, or they're too sad, or too tired or too afraid of something or other. Their over-active imaginations blow everything out of proportion. Like looking at something through water, everything is magnified and blurry.

If not a person, this card warns about travel by water, boats especially, but any water sport or activity. Check equipment, take safety measures, know where the lifeboats, lifeguard and life preservers are.
