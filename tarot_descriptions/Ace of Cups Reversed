Aces are the spark, the initial energy of the suit: unfocused, undirected, pure and new. For the Ace of Cups, a new emotion.

If we reverse the Aces then the most immediate opposite meaning is that there is no spark of energy, idea, emotion or luck, or that the potential for these is blocked.

So what does this mean in a reading? It likely means that the querent should be feeling a stirring of that ace, but isn't. He should feel emotions stirring as he, say, gazes at attractive people or his newborn child. But he feels nothing, empty (Ace of Cups reversed).

Reversed Aces are like trying to start a fire, and getting nothing.
