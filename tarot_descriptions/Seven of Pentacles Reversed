The Waiting Card - here the man waits for his labors to bear fruit. This is a card about patience and letting things ripen. Reversed, iy suggests that the energy of the card, patience, is blocked or not there. The person is impatient, pushing, rushing, tearing down the fruit before it is ripe.

If I got this for a querent, I'd worry that they were the sort to keep blowing their chances. The sort who creates something, then immediately puts it on the market before its ready, and it fails, because it's badly done, not polished and ready.
