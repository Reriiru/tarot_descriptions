Eight of Wands ***
Eight wands cut across the sky. When we finally put to use our human intellect to manage our energy, we find that we can really speed things up. This isn't about "taming" the energy, but rather avoiding waste and making the best use of it. This is our example of banking the fire so that we have more heat and light.

Another example would be knowing when to speed up on a highway and when to slow down. If we speed all the time, we may spin out of control on curves and crash. This way we not only get where we're going but often get there faster than those moving at top speed.

This card predicts fast developments, fast travel, things happening quickly and competently. Nothing wasted. Whatever is going on, the querent won't need to worry about it being on time, it should arrive early. Things will get done quickly and will develop in a speedy manner with energy to spare. This will be, in part, because they understand how their energy works, and how to limit it so as to get the most out of it.
