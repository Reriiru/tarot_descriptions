Page of Wands Reversed

***

Upright, our Page of Wands is an energetic, athletic newcomer who won't sit still. They are cheerful, warm, ready to help or come to the rescue, even if, being new, they don't quite know what to do.

Reversed, this Page can be a bully, using their strength and mean temper to get their way. Also a show-off, demanding that everyone pay attention to them. This is the new guy who will take credit for another's work in order to get the promotion.

If upright and not a person, this card is about messages regarding travel, spirituality, show-biz, career moves and leadership positions and party invitations. Reversed these messages are likely to be negatives in regards to this - no, you can't go on that trip, or sorry, you didn't get that job you wanted, or some other actress got the lead part. Also messages regarding problems with a party you might be throwing.
