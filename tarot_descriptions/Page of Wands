As a Child or "Child-like" Person: The Page of Wands is the sort of child (or child-like adult) who is full of energy. Manic, we might call him/her. They always want to go outside and play and are always getting into strange places, climbing trees, wanting to go to distant places, like to amusement parks or on camping trips. He/she is never home for dinner on time, and can be frustrating. However, he/she is also so charismatic and optimistic that they're often forgiven. He/she is but happy, fun-loving, enjoys being the center of attention and the leader.

Warn the querent, however, that being "immature" this person might tend to bully others or throw temper tantrums.
