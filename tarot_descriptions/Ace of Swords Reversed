Aces are the spark, the initial energy of the suit: unfocused, undirected, pure and new. For the Ace of Swords, a new idea.

If we reverse the Aces then the most immediate opposite meaning is that there is no spark of energy, idea, emotion or luck, or that the potential for these is blocked.

So what does this mean in a reading? It likely means that the querent should be feeling a stirring of that ace, but isn't. He should feel the start of a new idea, or a new speech he wants to give, but there's nothing.

Reversed Aces are like trying to start a fire, and getting nothing.
