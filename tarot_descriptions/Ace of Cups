A new spark of energy for a new passion.
Emotions are rising up for new love. The Ace of Cups usually indicates that the querent is feeling a new welling of emotion or beginning to have some vivid dreams.

They're not writing the poetry yet, but they feel the desire to, or they may have caught sight of a figure across a room and felt a tug at their heart, or even passed by some holy place and felt their spirit yearning.

They've lifted the cup and they want to drink from it.
