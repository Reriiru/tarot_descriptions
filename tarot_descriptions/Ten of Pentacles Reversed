Upright, this card is about fortunes or legacies that can be either passed onto the next generation or used to benefit others. The Querent transforms the earthly (money) into spiritual good by using it for the benefit of all (building a library, for example).

Reverse this card and we see a fortune or legacy wasted or lost. The children eat up their potential inheritance with luxurious living, or the parent with the fortune gambles it away, or it gets taken away by creditors. This is also a card about squabbles over money, fights over legacies. A relative dies and the vultures descend to take their valuables. In the worst case, the children come to the reading of the will only to find that there is no money, only debts. The fortune they thought their parent had never really existed.
