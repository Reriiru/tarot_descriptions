The wonderful Six of Swords is all about escaping troubled waters. The boat may not have reached the shore, but it might well be in view. The answer to communication problems, mental worries, even science and math problems written on a chalkboard are becoming clear. Turn the card up-side-down and it's rather like overturning the boat. Everyone is in the water, the swords sinking to the bottom. Not only is there no getting the problem solves, but all that the boat was carrying gets lost as well.

If I got the reversed Six of Swords for a querent, I'd be worried that the poor person was going to lose all their important notes. That their computer might crash, or the person they needed to help them get to that other shore was going to suddenly move to another country, no forwarding address. The querent is going to have to swim for it and do the best they can without boat, oarsman or swords.
