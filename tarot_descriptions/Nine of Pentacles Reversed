This is a card about creature comforts; about a modest but beautiful home of one's own; the completion here is that luck, health, finances are solid and comfortable, able to give a person a beautiful and happy retreat.

Reversed, however, can indicate that there is nothing comfortable about this place. Instead of comfortable solitude there is loneliness. Instead of financial security, there is a price to pay. If I got this card for someone, I'd worry that they might have married someone for money - that they weren't happy, and were always worried that if they didn't satisfy their husband or wife they'd lose that home.

The home is neither secure, nor is it one's own; this could also be read as someone's long time home being sold out from under them, stolen from them in some way - or perhaps they were tricked out if it. The home belongs to another and, at best, the querent is a kind of prisoner in it. At worse, they might well find themselves evicted.
