Four of Wands Reversed

***

Often called "The marriage card", this is the card of foundations laid and ready to be built upon. Reversed would indicate a blockage of this energy. The foundation is not laid or not ready - the cement, perhaps, is still wet. Certainly if a reader got this for a querent engaged to be married, the reader may want to warn the querent that they ought to postpone the wedding. Something is not solid about the relationship and the couple are not ready to marry yet. Possibly the families aren't united either. All in all, if this card is reversed, it suggests that there is quicksand underneath rather than solid stone.
