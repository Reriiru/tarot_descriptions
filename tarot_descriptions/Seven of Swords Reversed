The "Thief" card is one of those ambiguous cards - is the querent the thief, who must steal in order to gain his goal? Or is he being preyed on by a thief, who he must stop in order to get to his goal? Either way, this is a card about sneaking around, about whispers and tricks. The underhanded method is the only way to succeed.

Turning this card upside-down helps us to interpret it reversed - the thief loses his stolen swords. Sneaking around isn't going to work, and in fact, it's a disaster because no one ends up with the swords. If I got this card I would warn the querent that cheating wasn't going to pay off. You get someone else to write that final exam paper for you, but then lose the paper and fail the class! It's a lot of sneaking around that leads to nothing. Rather like arranging to cheat with another man's wife only to find she went off to cheat on you with your best friend. The swords you were stealing vanish from your hands.
