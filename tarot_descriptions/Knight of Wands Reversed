Upright, this is our star quarterback; a warm-hearted, genuinely friendly fellow who loves to lead and win the battle for his team. He also likes to go out and celebrate afterwards. A fellow with irresistible charm, he is nevertheless open and honest, the natural center of attention and the one in the drivers seat. And he does like to drive as fast and as far as his stallion will take him.

Reverse this, and we get a bully who wants to win at any cost. This is an intimidating fellow who will threaten those who stand in his way - perhaps not physically, but he has influence, and acting talent. He'll turn on his charm and make people think you've wronged him. He'll thunder at his girlfriend (or if female, scream mercilessly at her boyfriend), blast his considerable and teenage-tough-like temper at those who bump into him at a bar, break and throw things, but when confronted, will be all humble and repentant, seeming so sincere that folk forgive him. This is the abusive boyfriend or girlfriend.

This is also the guy who will steal your spotlight away if he can. If you bring in something to show and tell, he's sure to bring in something bigger - he lets no one upstage him. With his charm he'll steal your girl (or if he's a girl, she'll steal your guy!), steal your friends, ingratiate himself with the boss and get that promotion you wanted...and no one but you will know the truth. Do not let his guy be your roommate. He'll trash the place and expect you to clean up, play his music loud at all hours, borrow your car and crash it. He's a nightmare.

If not a person, this card signals trouble travelling in a land vehicle (car, bus, train), most likely a motorcycle. Something is going to break--or there might be a crash from going too fast. Watch out.
