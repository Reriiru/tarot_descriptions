The Hierophant is the moral and social conscience of the deck. He offers spiritual guidance, he can stand for that favored spiritual leader who guides us all through troubled times and ethical dilemmas, or represent the wider rules of society, from common courtesy and social graces to laws and rules. When reversed...

1) Opposite: if we assume that the negative or worst qualities of the card are it's "opposite" qualities, then the reversed Hierophant is the hidebound prude. He is the man pounding on the holy book, insisting that every commandment must be followed to the letter. He refuses to listen to alternate interpretations of what is written, refuses to bend or flex. He teaches by rote, and had no mercy for those who disagree.

2) Blocked: We can better understand the negative of this card by viewing the blocking of energies. The Hierophant gets spiritual inspiration from above and makes it real on Earth. In psychological terms, he is the superego communicating and guiding the ego. If this is blocked, then the ego is without guidance. It has only the rules it wrote down to follow, with no knowledge of WHY such rules should be followed. Hence, the community is unable to adjust its laws, erase those that no longer apply or create new ones which might be needed. 

3) Upside-down: Upright, the Hierophant gives his words to his acolytes, with the "keys to the kingdom" at his feet. Turn him upside-down and it is the acolytes who are on top, the keys in their hands. The Hierophant's head/voice (superego/conscience) is below instead of above. He is grounded, and his words come from the earth, not from heaven. Meanwhile, his listeners are in power, using those keys with impunity to lock away secrets, rather than open them up. This card is very reminiscent of spiritual institutions who control information, maintain earthly power (where the leaders are rich and living in luxury, while their flock is poor and in need) and maintain rules to enforce their position.
