A most diligent knight, the Knight of Pentacles is very careful with his charge. This is the guy working two jobs to put himself through school or help his family. He's got everything organized and planned, and extra projects at home. He has his future mapped out, and has no resentment about starting at the bottom or working hard to succeed. Quiet and often solitary, he is the least reckless of the knights - though equally ambitious. He can be trusted with anything from secret passwords to locking up the business at night to dealing with vast sums of money. His integrity is his pride.

Reverse this card, however, and now you need to watch this guy. Instead of diligence, you've got sloppiness. He may appear to be working, but he's coasting. And if you give him money to buy something, he's going to find a way to buy it cheap so that he can pocket half that money. He is bitter and envious of anyone who is already a success and living large. He's likely to be a brown-noser, ready to ingratiate himself with those who can help him climb that ladder to wealth and the good life. He will do nothing for those who haven't money or connections.

He'll never leave a tip, he'll always ask for separate checks. Contrariwise, he might well be a reckless if small-time gambler, blaming his bad luck on others and never himself.

If not a person, this is a card about travelling over land on foot, hiking or cycling. Getting lost is a likelihood - take a compass and make sure your cell phone is charged. Watch out for washed out or muddy trails, and take a first aid kit.
