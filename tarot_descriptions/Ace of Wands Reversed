Aces are the spark, the initial energy of the suit: unfocused, undirected, pure and new. So for the Ace of Wands, they are new energy. 

If we reverse the Aces then the most immediate opposite meaning is that there is no spark of energy, idea, emotion or luck, or that the potential for these is blocked.

So what does this mean in a reading? It likely means that the querent should be feeling a stirring of that ace, but isn't. So, the querent should be feel excited at a new prospect or ambition, but doesn't.

Reversed Aces are like trying to start a fire, and getting nothing.
