Six of Wands ***
The Victory Card: A victorious man on a horse, carrying a wand with a laurel wreath, is applauded by all.

Here is the conclusion to what happened with the Five of Wands. Competition was fierce, the querent was bold and stood out not only as the winner, but as the crowd pleaser. Now he finds a unique equilibrium. The crowd offers the victor applause, which energizes him and makes him eager to keep winning. He, in turn, offers them a champion to adore, giving them energy and inspiration.

Both are uplifted: the victor with the adulation, the crowd with a hero to adulate.

We've all seen this sort of exchange of energy with sports or rock heroes who are "pumped up" by the enthusiasm of the crowd and in turn, put on a performance that energizes their fans. Of course, the star must keep putting on good shows if he expects to hold onto his fans, and the crowd must maintain their level of excitement to get their show. Which is why the card also carries a warning not to become too attached or reliant such shows or on such applause. Heroes can have bad days, and fans can drift away.

At this moment, however, the querent gets the victory and recognition they need to feel invincible, and gives back to those cheering him on.
