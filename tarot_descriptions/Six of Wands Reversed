Six of Wands Reversed

***

The victory card is all about success, applause and accolades. The energy the person put into their endeavour has paid off and they have won. Reverse it however, and we can easily see several interpretations: opposite being a defeat rather than a win, but more likely, the blocked interpretation of something getting in the way of victory. I would read this as either a victory delayed, or one achieved but not getting the applause it should get.

I have a friend who works in the movie business. He worked very hard on a movie, but when he saw the credits, is name was hidden away, barely there. This would be, to me, the Six of Wands reversed. The querent is cheated of the satisfaction and laurels he ought to have gotten for his hard work.
