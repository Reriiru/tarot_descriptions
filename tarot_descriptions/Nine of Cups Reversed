Nine of Cups Reversed

***

The "wish" card is really about the completion of family and Earthly happiness. It is a card about feasting with friends and family, the comforts of good food, good drink, love, friendship, cheer. This is why it's the "wish" card, because what more could anyone wish for?

Reverse it however, and you are not going to get what you wish. This is a card about a family (or friendship) falling apart; siblings, parents, friends and children are at best indifferent; at worst, they hate each other and want to cause each other misery and pain. There is vindictiveness and cruelty. Likely abuses, divorces, child custody cases, and indulgences (alcoholism) and/or psychological problems.

This might also signal a family coming apart; a family once close, having family gatherings, but disintegrating with each new generation until it's not really a family at all.
