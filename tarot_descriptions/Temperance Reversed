Upright, Temperance is all about synthesis, about creating a third, unique element out of two other, usually opposing, elements. Reversed, however....

1) Opposite: Temperance in the upright position is a scientist in his lab mixing chemicals until he finds the right formula, a cure for some disease/problem. The opposite of this isn't just a formula that fails to work, it's one that goes horribly wrong. Putting it another way, Temperance's solution to the problem, trying to mix together these two liquids, makes things worse rather than better. This is that sort of situation where two people or two groups, if brought together, will bring out the worse in each other.

2) Blocked: As the energy of Temperance is to temper, to mix and merge; blocking this energy creates "intemperance." In this case, the elements refuse to mix. Like oil and water, the querent cannot get them to blend. This might well be because the impulse to blend the two is being blocked; there is a lack of effort or ability on the part of querent or someone else to get the mixture just right. For one reason or another, Temperance, knowing just how to mix those two opposing elements, is blocked. Unblock it, and how to do the merging will come clear.

3) Upside-down: The Temperance card contains a lot of fascinating symbolism. The Angel has one foot in the water - in touch with intuition, emotions and the unconscious. The other foot is planted on the Earth, grounded in reality, understanding the practical side of the problem. The wings of Temperance indicate the airy mind while the sun rising in the background emphasizes the element of fire (passion). This intelligence understands the reality and the feeling involved, and has the drive to achieve great things. Reverse the card, however, and everything goes wrong - the mind loses touch with the reality of the problem, as well as its own passion and perspective. Trying to mix the ingredients under these circumstances is impossible.
